└── assets/                # Images, fonts, and static assets
```

### Key Services

- **MovellaBleService**: Handles BLE communication with Movella DOT sensors
- **HealthService**: Manages health data collection (steps, calories, distance)
- **AnalysisApi**: Processes movement data and generates analysis results
- **PatientService**: Manages patient data and assignments

### Data Flow

1. Sensor data is collected via BLE from Movella DOT sensors
2. Raw sensor data is converted to quaternion and Euler angle representations
3. Movement analysis algorithms process the data to extract metrics
4. Results are stored locally in SQLite and optionally synced with backend
5. UI components display analysis results and patient progress

## Setup Instructions

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joaopbs98/irhis.git
   cd irhis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Apply patches**
   The project uses `patch-package` to apply necessary patches to dependencies. Patches are automatically applied during `npm install` via the `postinstall` script.

4. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory if needed (currently not required for basic setup).

### iOS Setup

1. **Install CocoaPods dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend/ios
   pod install
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Configure signing**
   - Open `frontend/ios/demoirhisn.xcworkspace` in Xcode
   - Select the project in the navigator
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
   - Select your development team
   - Ensure bundle identifier matches `com.eucinovacao.irhismvp`

### Android Setup

1. **Configure Android SDK location**
   - Create or update `frontend/android/local.properties`:
     ```properties
     sdk.dir=/path/to/your/Android/sdk
     ```
   - On macOS, typically: `sdk.dir=/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk`

2. **Verify environment variables**
   ```bash
   echo $ANDROID_HOME
   echo $JAVA_HOME
   ```

3. **Test Android setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ./scripts/test-android-setup.sh
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The server will start on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application

#### Development Client (Recommended for BLE features)

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run start:dev-client
   ```

2. **Build and run on device**
   - iOS: `npm run ios:device` (requires connected iOS device)
   - Android: `npm run android` (requires connected Android device or emulator)

#### Expo Go (Limited functionality)

For quick testing without BLE features:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
Scan the QR code with Expo Go app. Note: BLE functionality is not available in Expo Go.

### Development Builds

Create a development build for testing native features:

**iOS:**
```bash
cd frontend
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

**Android:**
```bash
cd frontend
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

After the build completes, install the app on your device and run:
```bash
npm run start:dev-client
```

### Code Organization

- **Components**: Reusable UI components in `app/components/`
- **Screens**: Full-screen views in `app/screens/`
- **Services**: Business logic in `app/services/`
- **Types**: TypeScript definitions in `app/types/index.ts`
- **Context**: Global state management in `app/context/`

### TypeScript Configuration

The project uses strict TypeScript settings. Ensure all new code:
- Has proper type annotations
- Follows the existing type definitions
- Passes TypeScript compilation without errors

### Git Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of changes"
   ```

3. **Push and create pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Testing

### Running Tests

The project includes unit tests for analysis modules:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Test Coverage

Current test coverage includes:
- Analysis pipeline tests (`app/analysis/__tests__/`)
- Kinematics calculations (`kinematics.test.ts`)
- Metrics calculations (`metrics.test.ts`)
- ZIP file reading (`io/__tests__/zipReader.test.ts`)
- Local analysis API (`services/__tests__/localAnalysisApi.test.ts`)

### Manual Testing

For features requiring device testing:
1. Build a development client
2. Install on physical device
3. Test BLE connectivity with Movella DOT sensors
4. Verify exercise recording and analysis

## Building and Deployment

### Development Builds

Development builds include debugging capabilities and are for internal testing:

```bash
cd frontend
eas build --profile development --platform ios
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### Preview Builds

Preview builds are for internal distribution (APK for Android):

```bash
cd frontend
eas build --profile preview --platform android
```

### Production Builds

Production builds are optimized for App Store and Play Store distribution:

**iOS (App Store):**
```bash
cd frontend
eas build --profile production --platform ios
```

**Android (Play Store - App Bundle):**
```bash
cd frontend
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

### Build Configuration

Build profiles are configured in `frontend/eas.json`:
- `development`: Development client with debugging
- `preview`: Internal distribution (APK for Android)
- `production`: Store distribution (App Bundle for Android, IPA for iOS)

### Submission

After building, submit to app stores:

```bash
cd frontend
eas submit --platform ios
eas submit --platform android
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Android Build Failures

**Issue**: SDK location not found
- **Solution**: Ensure `ANDROID_HOME` is set and `local.properties` exists in `frontend/android/`

**Issue**: Java version mismatch
- **Solution**: Verify JDK 17 is installed and `JAVA_HOME` points to it

**Issue**: Gradle build errors
- **Solution**: Clean build: `cd frontend/android && ./gradlew clean`

#### iOS Build Failures

**Issue**: CocoaPods installation errors
- **Solution**: Update CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`, then `pod install --repo-update`

**Issue**: Code signing errors
- **Solution**: Configure signing in Xcode project settings

#### BLE Connection Issues

**Issue**: BLE not available in Expo Go
- **Solution**: Use a development build. BLE requires native modules not available in Expo Go

**Issue**: Sensors not discovered
- **Solution**: Ensure Bluetooth permissions are granted and sensors are in pairing mode

#### Pedometer Warnings (Android)

**Issue**: `Pedometer.getStepCountAsync` warnings on Android
- **Solution**: These warnings are expected. The app uses `watchStepCount` as a fallback on Android, which is the correct behavior.

### Debugging

1. **Check logs**: Use `npx expo start` and monitor console output
2. **React Native Debugger**: Use React Native Debugger for advanced debugging
3. **Device logs**: 
   - iOS: `xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream` or Xcode console
   - Android: `adb logcat` or Android Studio Logcat

### Getting Help

1. Check existing documentation in the `docs/` directory
2. Review error messages in console logs
3. Consult team members for platform-specific issues
4. Review Git history for similar issues and solutions

## Configuration Files
